# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**An integrative dynamic model of brain energy metabolism using in vivo neurochemical measurements.**   
Cloutier M, Bolger FB, Lowry JP, Wellstead P. _J Comput Neurosci_ 2009
Dec;27(3):391-414 [19396534](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19396534) ,  
**Abstract:**   
An integrative, systems approach to the modelling of brain energy metabolism
is presented. Mechanisms such as glutamate cycling between neurons and
astrocytes and glycogen storage in astrocytes have been implemented. A unique
feature of the model is its calibration using in vivo data of brain glucose
and lactate from freely moving rats under various stimuli. The model has been
used to perform simulated perturbation experiments that show that glycogen
breakdown in astrocytes is significantly activated during sensory (tail pinch)
stimulation. This mechanism provides an additional input of energy substrate
during high consumption phases. By way of validation, data from the perfusion
of 50 microM propranolol in the rat brain was compared with the model outputs.
Propranolol affects the glucose dynamics during stimulation, and this was
accurately reproduced in the model by a reduction in the glycogen breakdown in
astrocytes. The model's predictive capacity was verified by using data from a
sensory stimulation (restraint) that was not used for model calibration.
Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the model parameters, this
showed that the control of energy metabolism and transport processes are
critical in the metabolic behaviour of cerebral tissue.
